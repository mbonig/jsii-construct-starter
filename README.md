  - [ ] name
  - [ ] description
  - [ ] jsii.targets
  - [ ] keywords ("cdk" for enrollment in the Construct Catalog)

# This is a pre-release!

This is a quick first-draft. All the options that will likely need to be added to accomodate a large
number of use-cases are still needed. If you'd like to make requests or help update this construct, please
open an [Issue](https://github.com/mbonig/cicd-spa-website/issues) or a [PR](https://github.com/mbonig/cicd-spa-website/pulls).
